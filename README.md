# Count_Down-Timer
 - Implemented a Timer circuit its objective was to be given a specific number in binary through switches, upon clicking start the circuit starts to countdown till it reaches the zero, hence a Buzzer is released and the counting procedure stops. -Utilized simulation tools: Schematic (Proteus), PCB layout (fusion 360, Proteus), VHDL (Vivado).
